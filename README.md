**JEasy Rule Engine**

`/demo` : Demo is in this folder. Classes in the folder are not real implementation. They will be updated. 

`/rules`: Rules for Co-Inform platform are stored in this folder. Rules will be updated based on API specifications and class implementations.

`/resources/config/config.properties`: parameters of the manager are stored in this file.


**TODOs**
Observation: when rules have same condition, only first one is executed. Composite rule definition should be tried. 
e.g: marking policies.
